Node.js is a javascript runtime environment that allows you to run javascript code outside the browser- mainly used for building backend(server-side) applications.

----------------key features------------
1. non-blocking i/o = handles multiple requests at the same Time(asynchronous).
2. event-driven architecture = reacts to events like "request received","file read complete", etc.
3. single-threaded = but very efficient due to event loop.
4.fast performance = because it uses v8 engine.
5. cross-platfrom = works on windows , mac os ,linux.

-------------applications----------------
1. web applications (api)
2. real-time chat apps (whatsapp clone)
3. RESTful APIs

---------------companies------------
-netflix
-linked in
-uber 
-paypal 
-walmart 
-etc 

----------------why learn it------------
-same language for front end and back end
-huge job demand
-easy to get started
-fast-growing ecosystem with npm(node package manager)

-------------------how it works---------------------
core components :

1. v8 engine:
    - JS engine built by google 
    - compiles js code to machine code

2. libuv:
    -cpp lib to handle all the asynchronous functions

3. Node.js APIs:
    - built in modules like fs, http, path, etc

flow of node.js program :
- js code is written.
- v8 engine compiles and runs it.
- for i/o tasks, libuv send tasks to threadpool
- main thread continues running (non-blocking)
- when i/o finishes, callback goes to the eventloop
- event loop runs the callback at right time

code flow:
user code
    |
v8 engine - runs js
    |
  libuv - handles i/o
    |
threadloop - offloads long task
    |
eventloop - waits for task to finish
    |
callback
